# **kickstarter-analysis**
Performing analysis on several thousand crowfunding projects ``Kickstarter data`` to uncover any hidden trents
## Overview of Project
How different campaingns fared in relation to their lauch dates and their funding goals

### **Analysis and Challenges**

Look at the data and defined what type of data is getting used for this analysis and update the data by sorting, filtering, condititonal formatting.
I have broken down the category/subcategeory into a parent category and a subcategory, therfore I can make this analysis more deatil and based on the parent category for all countries and as the chart demonstrates below; theather, music and film&video had great outcomes for sucessfull campaings. We can also visuaize the how many of these projects have been canceled, failed or still running.
