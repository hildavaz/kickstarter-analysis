Performing analysis on several thousand crowfunding projects ``Kickstarter data`` to uncover any hidden trents
## Overview of Project
How different campaingns fared in relation to their lauch dates and their funding goals

### **Analysis and Challenges**

Look at the data and defined what type of data is getting used for this analysis and update the data by sorting, filtering, condititonal formatting.
I have broken down the category/subcategeory into a parent category and a subcategory, therfore I can make this analysis more deatil and based on the parent category for all countries. There are over 4,000 Kickstarter campaings, the countriies with most of the campaings are the US with 3038 and Great Britain with 604. As the chart demonstrates below; theather, music and film&video had great outcomes for sucessfull campaings.  However, the theater parent category is the most successfull.

Is the length of a campaign correlated with its success? As the results for the following table and chart the month that launched the most successful Kickstarter campaigns was May, however January, June and July and October all had roughly the same number of failed campaigns launched.  If I filter these results by subcategory, there is a trend that the successful campaigns were started in June but the tapers off were started by the end of year.
